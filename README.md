# Password Manager Project Specification

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a secure and user-friendly password manager application for local use. The application should allow users to store, retrieve, and manage their passwords and other sensitive information in an encrypted format. The password manager should be designed as a single executable file that can be easily distributed and used on different systems.

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Authentication**:

- [ ] The application should prompt the user to set a master password during the initial setup.
- [ ] Subsequent launches should require the user to enter the correct master password for authentication.
- [ ] Implement a secure key derivation function (e.g., Argon2, scrypt, or PBKDF2) to derive an encryption key from the master password.

2. **Password Management**:

- [x] Allow users to add new password entries, including the website/service name, username, and password.
- [x] Provide functionality to view, update, and delete existing password entries.
- [x] Implement a search feature to quickly find password entries.
- [x] Support copying passwords to the clipboard with a single action (e.g., a keyboard shortcut or button click).

3. **Password Generation**:

- [x] Include a password generation feature that allows users to generate strong, random passwords based on customizable rules (e.g., length, character sets, etc.).

4. **Password Strength Checking**:

- [ ] Implement a password strength checker that evaluates the strength of user-provided passwords and provides feedback.

5. **Data Encryption**:

- [ ] Use a secure encryption algorithm like AES-256 or ChaCha20-Poly1305 to encrypt the password data before storing it.
- [ ] Ensure that the encryption key is securely derived from the master password and is not stored in plain text.

6. **Data Storage**:

- [ ] Store the encrypted password data in a local file or an embedded database (e.g., BoltDB).
- [ ] Implement functions to read and write the encrypted data securely.

7. **User Interface**:

- [ ] Develop a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) using Go's standard library or third-party libraries like `fyne` or `gocui`.
- [ ] Ensure that the user interface is intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly.

8. **Portability**:

- [ ] Package the application as a single executable file that can be easily distributed and run on different systems without additional dependencies.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Security**:

- [ ] Adhere to best practices for secure coding, input validation, and error handling.
- [ ] Implement secure key storage and key derivation techniques.
- [ ] Ensure that the application follows relevant data protection and privacy regulations.

2. **Performance**:

- [ ] Optimize the application for efficient memory usage and fast response times.
- [ ] Implement caching or indexing techniques if necessary for large datasets.

3. **Testability**:

- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for the encryption, data storage, and password management functions.
- [ ] Ensure that the application is thoroughly tested with different scenarios and edge cases.

4. **Maintainability**:

- [ ] Follow clean coding practices and write well-documented code.
- [ ] Organize the codebase into separate packages or modules for better maintainability.

5. **Extensibility**:

- [ ] Design the application with extensibility in mind, allowing for future enhancements or integrations (e.g., cloud storage, synchronization across devices, etc.).

## Technical Details

1. **Programming Language**: Go (Golang)

2. **Project Structure**:

- Use Go modules for dependency management.
- Organize the codebase into separate packages (e.g., `main`, `manager`, `crypto`, `ui`).

3. **Version Control**:

- [github.com/kentonvp/go-passfish](github.com/kentonvp/go-passfish)

4. **Documentation**:

- Document the project thoroughly, including instructions for installation, usage, and development.

- Use code comments to explain the functionality and purpose of different components.

5. **Development Environment**:

- Go (version 1.22.2)
- Provide instructions for setting up the development environment.

6. **Build and Distribution**:

- Use Go's built-in tooling to create a single executable file for the application.
- Consider creating an installer or setup wizard for easier distribution and installation.

7. **Third-Party Libraries**:

- Specify any third-party libraries or dependencies required for the project, along with their versions and licenses.

8. **Continuous Integration and Deployment**:

- Set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline for automated testing and building.
- Consider implementing a continuous deployment (CD) process for releasing new versions of the application.

9. **Security Updates and Maintenance**:

- Establish a process for regularly updating the application with bug fixes, security patches, and new features.
- Stay informed about the latest security best practices and update the application accordingly.
